# E-Commerce Customer Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## About the Project

This is an end-to-end data analysis project where I cleaned and analyzed an e-commerce dataset using SQL and built an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
The goal was to understand customer behavior, track sales performance, and find patterns that could help a business make better decisions.

## Tools Used
-**Excel** - Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **MySQL** – for data cleaning and writing all analysis queries

- Calculated key metrics like total revenue, top products, and return rates
- Performed **RFM Analysis** to segment customers
- Analyzed monthly sales trends and product performance
- Built an easy-to-read dashboard in Power BI

## Key Insights

- Most revenue came from customers in the UK
- Ireland has the highest RFM score
- RFM analysis shows ~37% of customers are New 
- RFM analysis shows ~27% of customers are Lost


This project helped me go beyond just building dashboards. I worked through actual cleaning issues, wrote SQL to prep the data myself, and built visuals that answer real business questions — not just pretty charts.
Thanks for checking it out!
